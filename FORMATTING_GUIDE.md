```

**AFTER:**
```
📚 Main Answer:
Loudness is a physiological response of the ear to the intensity of sound. 
The amount of sound energy passing each second through unit area is called 
the intensity of sound.

💡 Key Points:
• The audible range of hearing for average human beings is in the frequency 
  range of 20 Hz – 20 kHz.
• Sound waves with frequencies below the audible range are termed "infrasonic" 
  and those above.

🎓 Educational Context: This relates to acoustics and wave physics.
